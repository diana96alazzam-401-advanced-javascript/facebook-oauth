### Overall Score and Comments
#### Score (Out of 10): 

#### Pros
* Facebook is a very popular platform which will encourage people to sign up to our app since it's easier.
* The facebook developer website is organized and its easy to find what you want in.
* As a developer, I will be able to access some of the Userâ€™s information on Facebook (likes, interests, and friends)


#### Cons
* The documentation is not clear.
* You can't test on local host because you need https.
* They changed somethings lately but most of online resources are not updated and there is no clear explanation on what we should do exactly.

### Ratings and Reviews
#### Documentation
Everything is in its place but somehow it's confusing and you can't get out of a linear path to do one thing. 
#### Systems Requirements
Above and beyond 'node' and 'linux', what dependencies or core requirements exist for this framework?  Can it play at AWS/Heroku?  Does it require a certain database?
 - No specific requirements

#### Ramp-Up Projections
How long would/should it take a team of mid-junior developers to become productive?
I don't understand the question.

#### Community Support and Adoption levels
Facebook has almost 2.5 billion monthly active users so this makes it helpful to make users loging using it.
